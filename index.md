## Overview

This is a a Data Science Capstone Project investigated and put together by **Luke Taylor**, **Muchan Li**, and **Raymond Song** under the mentorship of ***Albert Hsiao, MD, PhD***. All are affiliated with the Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. Professor Hsiao is additionally affiliated with UC San Diego Health and Radiology Department.

## Problem Statement and Motivation

Deep learning models like convolutional neurla networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising ways of application in automating radiograph analysis, detecting conditions such as pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, and so forth. However, vast amount of data other than the radiographs has been left out, such radiologist reports, in the modeling process and can potentially make automation and predicition more accurate and usable. Inspired by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), we‚Äôre exploring multi-modal models that integrate text and image data for improved results.

### Quick setup

To give you a running start I've put together some starter kits that you can download, fork or even deploy immediately:

- ‚öóÔ∏èüç® Vanilla Jekyll starter kit  
  
- ‚öóÔ∏èüå≤ Forestry starter kit  
  [![Deploy to Forestry](https://assets.forestry.io/import-to-forestry.svg)](https://app.forestry.io/quick-start?repo=daviddarnes/alembic-forestry-kit&engine=jekyll){:style="background: none"}  
  [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-forestry-kit){:style="background: none"}
- ‚öóÔ∏èüí† Netlify CMS starter kit  
  [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-netlifycms-kit&stack=cms){:style="background: none"}

- ‚öóÔ∏è:octocat: GitHub Pages with remote theme kit  
  {% include button.html text="Download kit" link="https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-kit/archive/remote-theme.zip" color="#24292e" %}
- ‚öóÔ∏èüöÄ Stackbit starter kit  
  [![Create with Stackbit](https://assets.stackbit.com/badge/create-with-stackbit.svg)](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic-stackbit-kit){:style="background: none"}

### As a Jekyll theme

1. Add `gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies
3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file
4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a Boilerplate / Fork

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
6. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.

    "content": "Overview\n\nThis is a a Data Science Capstone Project investigated and put together by Luke Taylor, Muchan Li, and Raymond Song under the mentorship of Albert Hsiao, MD, PhD. All are affiliated with the Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. Professor Hsiao is additionally affiliated with UC San Diego Health and Radiology Department.\n\n\n  Codebase&nbsp; github\n\n\n  Report üìù\n\n  Poster ü™ß\n\n  Team Info üë®‚Äçüíª\n\n\n\nProblem Statement and Motivation\n\nDeep learning models like convolutional neurla networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising ways of application in automating radiograph analysis, detecting conditions such as pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, and so forth. However, vast amount of data other than the radiographs has been left out, such radiologist reports, in the modeling process and can potentially make automation and predicition more accurate and usable. Inspired by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), we‚Äôre exploring multi-modal models that integrate text and image data for improved results.\n\nQuick setup\n\nTo give you a running start I‚Äôve put together some starter kits that you can download, fork or even deploy immediately:\n\n\n  \n    ‚öóÔ∏èüç® Vanilla Jekyll starter kit\n  \n  ‚öóÔ∏èüå≤ Forestry starter kit\n\n\n  \n    ‚öóÔ∏èüí† Netlify CMS starter kit\n\n  \n  \n    ‚öóÔ∏è:octocat: GitHub Pages with remote theme kit\nDownload kit\n  \n  ‚öóÔ∏èüöÄ Stackbit starter kit\n\n\n\nAs a Jekyll theme\n\n\n  Add gem \"alembic-jekyll-theme\" to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies\n  Add theme: alembic-jekyll-theme to your _config.yml file to set the site theme\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a GitHub Pages remote theme\n\n\n  Add gem \"jekyll-remote-theme\" to your Gemfile to add the theme as a dependancy\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Add jekyll-remote-theme to the list of plugins in your _config.yml file\n  Add remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main to your _config.yml file to set the site theme\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nAs a Boilerplate / Fork\n\n(deprecated, not recommended)\n\n\n  Fork the repo\n  Replace the Gemfile with one stating all the gems used in your project\n  Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: .github, LICENSE, screenshot.png, CNAME and alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec\n  Run the command bundle install in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy\n  Run bundle exec jekyll serve to build and serve your site\n  Done! Use the configuration documentation and the example _config.yml file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons\n\n\nCustomising\n\nWhen using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.\n\nTo add your own styles copy the styles.scss into your own project with the same file path (assets/styles.scss). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the @import \"alembic\"; line.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the _settings.scss file in your own styles.scss, make sure to state them before the @import \"alembic\"; line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from Sassline - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.\n",

All are affiliated with the Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. Professor Hsiao is additionally affiliated with UC San Diego Health and Radiology Department.\n\n\n  Codebase&nbsp; github\n\n\n  Report üìù\n\n  Poster ü™ß\n\n  Team Info üë®‚Äçüíª\n\n\n\nProblem Statement and Motivation\n\nDeep learning models like convolutional neurla networks (CNNs) have demonstrated promising ways of application in automating radiograph analysis, detecting conditions such as pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, and so forth. However, vast amount of data other than the radiographs has been left out, such radiologist reports, in the modeling process and can potentially make automation and predicition more accurate and usable. Inspired by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), we‚Äôre exploring multi-modal models that integrate text and image data for improved results.\n\n\n\nObjectives\n\n\n  Navigate how multi-modal models are used to leverage both X-Ray reports and images to generate reports.\n  Assess whether the generated reports mimic the style of reports written by the expert readers.\n  Assess the accuracy of the generated reports in identifying pathologies.\n    \n      Determine whether additional context in the text input of an LLM improves generated text outcomes.\n    \n  \n  Explore the effect of prompt engineering on report generation and accuracy.\n    \n      Evaluate and quantify the improvement in the LLM for Chest X-rays given more context.\n    \n  \n\n\nMethods\n\n\n  About 100K Chest Radiographs and their text reports from UCSD Health.\n    \n      We split our data so that there are 96119 x-ray images and corresponding reports for training and 2088 pairs for testing.\n    \n  \n  Fine-tuned a Large Language Model (LLM) with vision capabilities instead of training both a vision CNN tower and a LLM from scratch\n  Using Large Language and Vision Assistant v1.5 (LLaVA, see [1][2][3]) as the base model which is based on Vicuna 13B v1.5 and CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder\n  Input is an X-ray and then a prompt that may include information about the previous clinical history and additional patient context.\n  Ground truth output is actual radiologist report for the corresponding X-ray\n  The fine-tuning of the model was done using a Nvidia RTX A6000 with LORA adapters due to GPU memory constraints.\n  Evaluated with cosine similarity scores between bio term specific sentence transformer embeddings.\n  Extracted label probabilities for common lung conditions using Facebook BART zero shot classification to evaluate diagnostic accuracy.\n\n\nFindings and Results\n\nIn this section, we will present the insights obtained from analyzing the radiograph reports and training and testing different tricks to LLaVA model. We will focus our presentation more on the latter.\n\nExpert Radiologists\n\nAs presented above, we identified 10 most prominent radiologist readers from our X-rays and reports dataset. They are in combine responsible for 86% of the readings in both the training and testing set.\n\nSimilarity Between Generated Reports and Expert Ground Truths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on each radiologist‚Äôs name below to learn model‚Äôs performance with respect to each individual:\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Seth Kligerman\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Lewis Hahn\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Michael Horowitz\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Ravi Rajpoot\n  \n\n\n  üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Sharon Brouha\n  \n\n\n  üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Kathleen Jacobs\n  \n\n\n  üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Elizabeth Weihe\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Albert Hsiao\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. William Ladd\n  \n\n\n  üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Dr. Andrew Yen\n  \n\n\nPrompts Constructed\n\n\n\nThe prompt on the left is designed to be generic, similar to the one used in [4] for querying model responses. It serves as our benchmark. The prompt on the right is more context-embedded and -specific. It‚Äôs design is largely inspired by the spirits of chain-of-thought prompting proposed in [5]. We aim to embed more patient history and x-ray context in prompting the model to give a more holistic reading of the x-ray, treating as if it is a real diagnostic expert.\n\n\n\nPathology Detection Outcomes\n\nX-Rays and Ground Truths\n\n\n  \n  Pathology Present (Left) vs. Normal (Right) Chest X-Ray\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Generated Reports\n\n\n\nOne can see that when LLaVA is prompted with the baseline generic prompt, the readings responses to both X-rays, regardless of pathological entities, are simply direct copies of each other. This indicates that either LLaVA has not learned any X-ray specific imaging feature and just memorized the report text (since the prompt are first fed to the model via fine-tuning), or that the prompt is not specific enough to elicit reasoning.\n\nThen, when we prompted LLaVA with the context-embedded prompt, we can see that LLaVA instead can articulate distinct findings with regard to each X-ray. Specifically, since we provided the corresponding radiologist reader, the model did better in memorizing and mimicking reader-specific reporting style. Moreover, the seemingly increased pathology detection accuracy‚Äìas an example, LLaVA correctly identified interval removal of a right IJ (sheath)‚Äìsuggests that model is now better at comprehending the task and retrieving the relevant vision and language features.\n\n\n\nQuantified Outcomes\n\n\n\nAccording to the ROC plot on the left, LLaVA‚Äôs accuracy in detecting pathological entities when prompted using the generic prompt is no better than random chance (represented by the dotted diagonal line), with the highest area under the curve (AUC) at 0.53 for detecting cardiomegaly in its generated reports.\n\nAccording to the ROC plot on the right, LLaVA‚Äôs accuracy in detecting pathological entities when prompted using the context-embedded prompt has increased, with AUC for all pathological entities placed above 0.50. The best detection accuracy LLaVA‚Äôs presented is in identifying pneumothorax, with AUC at 0.73. This AUC score is considered fair by conventional standards.\n\n\n\nThe histogram on the left represents the test-set cosine similarity scores between the semantic embeddings of LLaVA generated reports according to the genetic prompt and corresponding ground truth reports. The distribution is approximately normal, centered at 0.52.\n\nThe histogram on the left represents the test-set cosine similarity scores between the semantic embeddings of LLaVA generated reports according to the context-embedded prompt and corresponding ground truth reports. The distribution is more left-skewed, with a diminishing tail in the low-scoring regions. It is now centered at 0.63, indicating that the responses are now more semantically similar to ground truths compared to the ones before, which means LLaVA has indeed learned to mimic the reporting of each radiologist more closely.\n\n\n\nFuture Directions\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li, and Yong Jae Lee.\nImproved baselines with visual instruction tuning, 2023.\n\n[2] Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li, Bo Li, Yuanhan Zhang, Sheng Shen, and\nYong Jae Lee.
